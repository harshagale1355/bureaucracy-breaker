## What This Project Is

Bureaucracy Breaker is a browser-based assistant that helps users complete complex government and institutional forms by turning them into a simple, guided conversation.

Instead of struggling with long instructions, legal language, or unfamiliar terms, users are guided step-by-step by an AI “clerk” that:
- Explains what each form field means
- Asks questions in plain language
- Fills the form side-by-side as the user answers

The goal is not automation, but **understanding and assistance**.

## The Core Problem

Many government and scholarship forms are difficult not because they require complex data, but because they are written in administrative or legal language that normal users do not understand.

As a result:
- Users fear making mistakes
- Applications are often incorrect or incomplete
- People depend on agents or middlemen just to fill forms
- Time and money are wasted on avoidable errors

This problem is especially common for:
- Students applying for scholarships
- First-time applicants
- Immigrants and elderly users
- Non-technical users

## Our Approach

We approach this problem as a **usability and comprehension issue**, not a data entry problem.

Bureaucracy Breaker:
- Works inside the user’s browser
- Does not bypass logins or security
- Does not submit forms automatically
- Keeps the user in control at all times

The system behaves like a helpful clerk sitting beside the user, explaining each step before asking for input.

## What Is Included in This Hackathon Build

For the hackathon prototype, the project focuses on:

- Assistive filling of live web forms  
- Field-by-field explanation using a chat interface  
- Side-by-side autofill while the user reviews  
- Clear boundaries around security and ethics  

The emphasis is on **clarity, reliability, and trust** rather than full automation.

## What Is Explicitly Out of Scope

To avoid unsafe or unreliable behavior, this prototype does not include:
- Automatic login
- CAPTCHA solving
- Automatic form submission
- OCR on scanned image-only documents
- Backend bots or scripted browser automation

These exclusions are intentional design decisions.

## Why This Overview Exists

This document serves as:
- A high-level introduction for judges and reviewers
- Context for all planning documents in the `/kiro/` folder
- A reference point to ensure all later decisions align with the original intent

Detailed scope, architecture, roles, and technical tradeoffs are documented in the files that follow.

## Summary

Bureaucracy Breaker does not try to replace government systems or automate users away.

It focuses on making complex forms **understandable**, **approachable**, and **less intimidating** by turning bureaucracy into a conversation.
